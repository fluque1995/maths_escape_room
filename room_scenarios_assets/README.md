# Room scenarios assets

In this folder, the PNGs that define the rooms structure are given. There are
two files for each room of the listed in the main README, `<room_name>_bg.png`
and `<room_name>_fg.png`. `_bg.png` files define the background of the room,
while`_fg.png` files define the foreground. The basic difference between
background and foreground is that background images are below the participants,
while foreground images are over them. An in-depth explanation about background
and foreground can be found in [Gather's Help Center - Background &
Foreground](https://support.gather.town/help/background-foreground).

All the maps presented here have been created using
[Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/). Tiled is a general purpose tile map
editor, recommended by Gather Town for maps creation. The assets employed to
create the maps are given openly by Gather Town at
