# Exercises' material

This folder contains the additional material developed for the problems. Most of
this information are parts of the task statements, which will be explained
below. Since we present the statements in a fragmented way, for each task, we
will show the complete assignment to be solved, and present the three fragments
afterwards. It is done this way because we think it is important to get the
broader picture of the statement before delving into the fragments.

> DISCLAIMER: Although the statements are listed in english below, all the
> generated material is in spanish. Adapt it to english if needed

## Exercise 1: Calculate fence size using a system of equations

### Complete statement

Given the following diagram, and knowing that the building walls facing the
courtyard have the same length, the exterior fence is 5 m shorter than either of
the two building walls, and that the perimeter of the courtyard is 25 m, how
long is one building wall?

### Fragments given to the students

__Player 1__: Building walls facing the courtyard have the same length. The
perimeter of the courtyard is 25 m.

__Player 2__: The exterior fence of the courtyard is 5 m shorter than either of
the two building walls.

__Player 3__: Finds the diagram shown above

## Exercise 2: Calculate statistics of a population

### Complete statement

Through the windows of the building you can see a group of people. Each of you
can see some of them. Be careful, because some people might be seen by more than
one of you, but you want to count their information only once. We know that
there are 9 people in total. We want to calculate the average of their heights.

NOTE: When compiling the information, you will have to coordinate to avoid
counting the repeated individuals twice.
