# Exercises' material

This folder contains the additional material developed for the problems. Most of
this information are parts of the task statements, which will be explained
below. Since we present the statements in a fragmented way, for each task, we
will show the complete assignment to be solved, and present the three fragments
afterwards. It is done this way because we think it is important to get the
broader picture of the statement before delving into the fragments.

> DISCLAIMER: Although the statements are listed in english below, all the
> generated material is in spanish. Adapt it to english if needed
