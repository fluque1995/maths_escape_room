# Maths Escape Room

This repository contains the source code and assets developed for our research
project about mathematical communication. In it, we propose an activity based on
a Escape Room whose aim is to improve the mathematical communication among our
students.

The game is developed using the platform ![Gather Town](https://gather.town). This platform aims to
convert virtual interactions into a more human experience. To that purpose, they
offer a website with capability to create virtual spaces where attendants can
interact with each other and the surroundings. Moreover, they provide an (still
experimental) API ![(docs)](http://gather-game-client-docs.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/modules.html) to interact with the spaces programmatically. Using
this API, objects can be placed in the environment, and they can be provided
with interactivity.

We leverage the flexibility of the platform and the API they provide to build an
interactive activity for our students. The activity is prepared to be played by
a group of 3 students, and it is composed of 5 tasks, ordered by ascending
difficulty.

This repository provides all the information needed to setup the activity with
your own students.
